<p>A collaboration between legendary design brand Anglepoise (pioneers of the modern task lamp), and the esteemed British designer Margaret Howell, this handsome desk lamp was designed by Sir Kenneth Grange. The Type 75 is inspired by a 1970’s version of the Anglepoise Apex 90, originally launched in the 1950’s. Grange reinterprets the modernist lines and no-frills functionality of its predecessor for new generations. Margaret Howell has lent her inimitable eye to the color choices of this special collaboration</p>

<li> <h3>BALLAST BOOKBAG</h3> </li>
<img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0880/2454/products/Screen_Shot_2015-10-09_at_4.35.34_PM_295x.png?v=1537393779" alt="">
<p>Our signature bookbag, designed in collaboration with Ken Nishijo of Raregem Japan, a Tokyo based cabinet-making studio and bag builder.</p>
<p>A stunningly well-made bag that ages beautifully, this large tote’s #4 Selvedge Canvas is made on looms imported to Japan from Belgium in the 1930’s, and the nude leather handles come from one the oldest and best tanners in Tokyo. The remarkably precise stitching is all hand-done by Nishijo’s own family in his workshop, and each bag carries our motto about book-carrying, hand screened on the inside:</p>
<p> <strong>“I try to carry books with me wherever I go. Their weight has become like ballast against the churning sea of modern life, where so many real things are vanishing, and so many beautiful things are being made invisible.”</strong></p>
<p>It sits open on the floor like a box, but is so balanced and perfectly constructed that it feels almost weightless (letting your books be the ballast, not your bag!). The two interior pockets fit most smartphones, and the strap will fit over most shoulders.</p>
<p>Made in Japan. 18″ W x 21 1/4″ H x 10″ D. Handles have a 7″ drop. 100% Made in Japan “in small batches on old equipment”.</p>
