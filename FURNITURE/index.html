<h3>C-218 BOOKCASE FOR SFMOMA</h3>
</li>

<p>Our newest case was designed by Book/Shop for a very exciting commission from the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, on the occasion of their re-opening in May, 2016. A handsome and sturdy chairside bookcase, the C-218 (named for the gallery in the Museum where the cases reside) is hand-made in Oakland of solid American Birch to museum-grade standards. Every plane & angle requires meticulous workmanship (its made with 100% joinery, no screws or metal of any kind are used throughout), and the piece is finished off with a Zero-VOC finish that's one of the best in the world.
</p>
<p>
  Made to house a large assortment of art books in a compact space, the C-218 also features an open area at its back. In the Museum, this area houses phone-charging equipment, but in your home it's a perfect spot for oversized books or cord management.
</p>
<p>
  Built to take the rough treatment of SFMoMA's high-volume public space, this bookcase will last a lifetime in regular home use, while staying timeless in its looks and outstanding in its function. The books are angled up for comfortable viewing from a standing or sitting position, avoiding the low crouching position usually required to view books shelved close to the floor. (In fact, we used the same angle for the inner shelf as we use in our classic SSB series).  The top of the unit is just deep enough to hold a lamp or devices being charged, but not so deep as to block the view of the books or make them difficult to retrieve. Books up to 14" high are lifted out or put back with ease.
</p>
<p>
  This item is hand-made to order in Oakland, California exclusively for BOOK/SHOP by David Farrell of Verksted. Please allow 4-6 weeks for delivery.

<h3>LBR-1 IN SOLID ASH</h3>

<p> Meet the newest addition to our furniture line, THE LBR-1 Book Stool. This little helper works well as a nightstand, side table, or stool.
</p>
<p>
  All pieces of the LBR series are born from a one-inch solid piece of FSC-certified lumber, hand-picked for color and consistency of grain. The lumber is then planed down to just shy of ¾”, giving it a lighter look that retains its strength. Next the boards travel through a jointer, becoming straight and true before being adjoined side-by-side using mortise and tenon, creating the top and legs of the bench. Screws and nails are forgone in this traditional method involving only wood and glue.
</p>
<p>
  Once the boards are properly sized, they go through a rigorous smoothing process with the use of scrapers and fine grit sandpaper. We chose finger joints for the LBR because they offer both strength and symmetrical beauty to the corners of the stool. Ours are made one at a time with a combination of a router and hand tools. During final assembly, 15 clamps hold everything perfectly in place while the glue sets. Finally, a special no-VOC, non-toxic, one-coat finish is rubbed on and buffed out by hand. The end result is a beautiful stool that is highly resistant to moisture and will last a lifetime.
