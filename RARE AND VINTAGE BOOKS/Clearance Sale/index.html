    <p>
"In the collection WRITINGS ON ART: TOM MARIONI 1969-1999, one of the early practitioners of conceptual art, Tom Marioni (1970 founder of MOCA, Museum of Conceptual Art in San Francisco), has compiled various essays, lectures, and poems about art that he both wrote and spoke about all over the country throughout a large portion of his career. In this collection, he documents his travels to Poland, Czechoslovakia, and Hungary where he met and exchanged ideas with other artists, developing his own ideas about conceptual art. "On my trip to Eastern Europe, it became clear to me that an artist who attempts to make art to reach 'the people' is making self-conscious art; he is like a politician trying to get votes"---from "Real Social Realism, 1976." In addition to expressing opinions and speaking specifically about the movement and the artists within the movement, Marioni draws connections between painting, music, writing, and sculpture."
