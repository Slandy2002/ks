      "L'Amour Fou (Crazy Love) has been acknowledged an undisputed classic of the surrealist movement since its first publication in France in 1937. Its adulation of love as both mystery and revelation places it in the most abiding of literary traditions. "There has never been any forbidden fruit. Only temptation is divine," writes André Breton, leader of the surrealists in Paris in the 1920s and '30s. L'Amour Fou is dedicated to defying "the widespread opinion that love wears out, like the diamond, in its own dust." Celebrating Breton's own love and lover, the book unveils the marvelous in everyday encounters and the hidden depths of ordinary things."

</p>
<p>
  From the photographer:
</p>
<p>
  "The poet, Carl Phillips and I spent a year corresponding, sending work back and forth until we found a poem and body of photographs that could choir together. Below is a brief description, Pacific Peace Piece.
</p>
<p>
  Summer, 2017 was stark.  Strident.  I spent most of it driving.  I started in El Paso.  When I got to the Sonoma Coast, it was mid afternoon, a dark fog abruptly rolled in.  It didn’t rain.  The clouds enveloped the countryside.  The temperature dropped dramatically.   All in what seemed like in an instant.  Things happen, things change.  Most of the time they’re not in our control.  Like our relationships with family, friends, lovers.  With our political, community, faith leaders and even with ourselves.  We can choose how we remember, how we process the time.   And we can, in that moment, decide to be resilient or defeated.
</p>
<p>
  Throughout my work, I’ve paired text and image.  Pacific Peace Piece continues in a similar vein with new photographs and “The Greatest Colors For The Emptiest Parts of The World,” a poem by Phillips.  It appears in fragments throughout the book.  The photographs, taken in Northern California in the Summer of 2017, explore a narrative of estrangement, destruction, resilience.
</p>
<p>
  The book’s title makes use of the Bill Evans song, Peace Piece.

<h3>SELECTED POEMS BY BARBARA GUEST (SIGNED) </h3>

Los Angeles, Sun & Moon Press (1995). Hardcover. First Edition/First Printing. Condition: Fine in Fine DJ. SIGNED on title page by the poet. A fresh and lovely copy. 200 pgs.
</p>
<p>
  "When first published in the 1960s, Guest was associated with the New York poets, a group, including John Ashbery and Frank O'Hara, that was influenced by the art world's abstract impressionist movement. But, as this important selection demonstrates, in the 30 years since then Guest has evolved a style of her own, combining meta-poetical, impressionistic word painting with philosophical musings evocative of symbolists like Mallarme. With rich language and refracted line-breaks and stanzas, she achieves a distinct tapestry-like quality, an effect complemented by a poetic landscape often populated by medieval icons and royal figures. Earlier poems like "Sand" and "A Handbook of Surfing" offer language as a sensual experience; in selections from her most recent collections, Fair Realism (1989) and Defensive Rapture (1993), her interest in visual aesthetics (Guest regularly contributes to Art News) seems translated into poetry: "I/ created a planned randomness in which color/ behaved like a star" ("The Screen of Distance"). Very like beautiful abstract paintings, Guest's poetry defies literal interpretation, its language setting the "tone values" of subjects ranging from the color black to the loss of memory. "
