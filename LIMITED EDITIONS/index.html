<p> For us, the best reading chair is a blanket on the beach or on the grass under a tree, so we’re introducing a series of “reading chair" throws featuring work by some of our favorite illustrators and artists. These woven pieces are made in the USA of 100% cotton. They're weighty & cozy & easy to clean. People use them as rugs, blankets, or as art on their walls. Any way you use them, they are beautifully made additions to your life.
</p>
<p>
  This series features original work by Iris de Mouy, a Paris-based artist whose illustrations have been commissioned by clients ranging from Hermes and Bonpoint to Colette and 0fr. Iris has created two designs exclusively for Book/Shop and we’re thrilled to offer them on our website. These designs are woven into the blankets, not merely printed on. The artwork's reverse colors are seen on the back of each blanket & the palette of each blanket shows in the blanket's colorful fringe.  See Iris's other design for Book/Shop here.

<p> Our tan and peach logo cap, made into a wearable work of art by Lilian Martinez of BFGF.

We're pleased to offer her latest offering for Book/Shop, a one-of-a-kind customized cap in Pale Khaki with our logo in Peach, illustrated with three original paintings by Martinez, whose work channels Matisse, Henry Moore, ancient pottery, and popular culture (in equal measure). Signed "Lil" in small lilac letters on the underneath of the cap's brim. One only, one size only in a unisex shape with fully adjustable strap.

<h3>ART EDITION NO. 1: “TO PLACE AMONG OTHER COLORS AND FORMS” THOMAS A. CLARK X BOOK/SHOP</h3>
</li>
<img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0880/2454/products/CLARK-1_295x.jpg?v=1469135295" alt="">
<p> We’re thrilled to announce the launch of our first ever art edition, a special collaboration with poet and artist Thomas A. Clark. This is the American edition of an earlier work by Clark for a show in Scotland, re-designed and produced in the US.
</p>
<p>
  A solid aluminum bar, painted a striking red-orange, and bearing the text “TO PLACE AMONG OTHER COLORS AND FORMS.” Limited to a numbered edition of 25 with accompanying edition card, produced and signed by Clark.
</p>
<p>
  This is an artwork intended to occupy different areas of your home over time, creating new relational experiences in areas you may have become “blind” to from over-familiarity. This piece asks you to re-see the arrangement it sits with as a group of colors and forms, and how the perception of that grouping changes with the introduction of this color and this form.
</p>
<p>
  2 feet long x 1 inch square. 2.6 lbs.
