JOIE DE LIVRES PRINT BY MARY MATSON FOR BOOK/SHOP
    </h3>

  <p>
We love Los Angeles-based artist and designer Mary Matson’s bright and vivid take on life. She was a natural to design this print, a pun on a French phrase that celebrates the joy of life we wanted translated into a poster. For us, much of life’s joy is wrapped up in “livres” (French for “books”). The print is 15″ x 22″, and two-color hand-screened on Arches paper in radiant red and blue from an original painting by Matson.
  </p>
  <p>
Arches papers are mouldmade in Lorraine, France with 100% cotton fiber content. They are acid-free, pH-neutral, gelatin-sized, and air-dried in a mill that’s been in operation since 1492. It has a beautiful color and texture and the print comes unframed, showing off the paper’s soft deckled edges. The screen printing is done in Oakland, California.

  <p>
When we find ourselves wasting time on mobile devices and feeling, frankly, robbed, we turn to this helpful and friendly reminder. This 15″ x 22″ print, hand screened on Arches paper, suggests a way to spend time in a way we never regret.
